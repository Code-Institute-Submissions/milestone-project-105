## UX

This project is part of the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Development course, specifically **Module 1: User-Centric Front-End**. The objective for this milestone project is to "*build a static front-end site to present useful information to users... data is presented in a way that helps users achieve their goals goals, e.g. learning about a product/service that they are interested in. The presentation of this data advances the site owner's goals, e.g. helps them market a product/service.*".

Lethal Apps is a company I founded in 2015 to provide software development services, specifically in the realm of mobile application development. This project is an opportunity to create a website to display the services Lethal Apps has to offer, to show-case previously published apps along with open-source portfolio work, and for customers to reach out to the agency to avail of these services. 

### User Stories

"**__As a user, I__** ______________________________________________"

- :white_check_mark: should be able to view the site from any device (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- :white_check_mark: should be presented with a site that meets accessibility guidelines including contrast between background and foreground colors, and non-text elements with alt text equivalents.
- :white_check_mark: should be presented with a website that has a flow of information layout and interaction feedback that is clear and unambiguous.
- :white_check_mark: should have all of my actions confirmed, where appropriate, and feedback should be given at all times.
- :white_check_mark: should be able to view a show-case of previously completed works by the company.
- :white_check_mark: should be able to make further enquiries by filling out an enquiry form.
- :white_check_mark: should be able to see testimonials from other customers that have used the services of this company. 
- :white_check_mark: should be able to see details on the company, including employee make-up, back-story, company vision, etc. 
- :white_check_mark: all interaction with the site should produce a positive emotional response. A first-time visitor should immediately be drawn-in.

"**__As a developer, I__** ______________________________________________"

- :white_check_mark: must maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organisation.
- :white_check_mark: must document testing fully to include evaluation of bugs found and their fixes and explanation of any bugs that are left unfixed.
- :white_check_mark: must test and deploy a front-end web application to a Cloud platform. HTML/CSS code pass through the official W3C validators with no issues.
- :white_check_mark: must ensure all HTML attribute and CSS rule names are consistent in format, appropriate and meaningful.
- :white_check_mark: must maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organisation.
- :white_check_mark: must ensure that when displaying media files, the site avoids aggressive automatic pop-ups and autoplay of audio; instead letting the user initiate and control such actions.



(*Note: :white_check_mark: denotes items that have been successfully implemented*).

### Design

The overall concept is a modern, eye-catching website that specifically show-cases work performed by the agency, and makes it easy for the customer to get in touch. I have designed my project using a *modern* and *minimalist* concept, with an overall clean, crisp look.

#### Framework

- [Boostrap v4.5](https://getbootstrap.com/)
Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

#### Color Scheme

- In keeping with the overall *modern* theme, I have opted for a bright color scheme with plenty of spacious white space. Colors are specifically tied into the logo colors for this company - yellow, red, off-green, with hints of minimalist grey. 

- `#ebf65c` (**yellow**)
- `#df3939` (**red**)
- `#a3ca87` (**green**)

#### Icons

- [Font Awesome 5.8.1](https://fontawesome.com/)
I have made extensive use of the following font awesome icons in this project: 

#### Typography

- I have incorporated a number of [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) throughout the entire application. The primary font I have selected is called [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro?query=source+sans+pro), because it fits into the overall *modern* and *minimalist* theme.

### Wireframes

- Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/).
