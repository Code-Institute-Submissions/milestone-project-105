## UX

This project is part of the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Development course, specifically **Module 1: User-Centric Front-End**. The objective for this milestone project is to "*build a static front-end site to present useful information to users...data is presented in a way that helps users achieve their goals goals, e.g. learning about a product/service that they are interested in. The presentation of this data advances the site owner's goals, e.g. helps them market a product/service.*".

Lethal Apps is a company I founded in 2015 to provide software development services, specifically in the realm of mobile application development. This project is an opportunity to create a website to display the services Lethal Apps has to offer, to show-case previously published apps along with open-source portfolio work, and for customers to reach out to the agency to avail of these services.

### Design

The overall concept is a modern, eye-catching website that specifically show-cases work performed by the agency, and makes it easy for the customer to get in touch. I have designed my project using a *modern* and *minimalist* concept, with an overall clean, crisp look.

#### Framework

- [Boostrap v4.5](https://getbootstrap.com/)
Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

#### Color Scheme

- In keeping with the overall *modern* theme, I have opted for a bright color scheme with plenty of spacious white space. Colors are specifically tied into the logo colors for this company - yellow, red, off-green, with hints of minimalist grey. 

`#ebf65c` (**yellow**)
`#df3939` (**red**)
`#a3ca87` (**green**)

#### Icons

- [Font Awesome 5.8.1](https://fontawesome.com/)
I have made extensive use of the following font awesome icons in this project: 

#### Typography

- I have incorporated a number of [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) throughout the entire application. The primary font I have selected is called [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro?query=source+sans+pro), because it fits perfectly into the overall *modern* and *minimalist* theme. Aside from the built-in Materialize fonts, I have imported these Google Fonts:

### Wireframes

- Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/).

All of the wireframes for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/leithdm/milestone-project-1/tree/master/assets/wireframes) in the *wireframes* sub-directory.
