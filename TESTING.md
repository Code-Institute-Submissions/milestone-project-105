# Compatability

## Manual Testing

To ensure a broad range of users can successfully use this site, it was manually tested across the 6 major browsers:

- Chrome v.85
- Edge v.85
- Firefox v.81
- Safari v.12
- Opera v.71
- Internet Explorer v.11

<br/>

To test site responsiveness the following tools were used:

- [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)
- [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/)

<br/>

**Result:** Fully responsive [see table below].

![Responsive Design](readme-files/responsiveness.PNG)

<br/>

## Automated Testing

Automated testing was performed using [PowerMapper](https://www.powermapper.com/). This tool checks websites for **broken links, browser compatibility, accessibility, web standards validation, search engine issues, and general usability** under the following headers:
1. Errors
2. Accessibility
3. Compatibility
4. Search
5. Usability

<br/>

### 1. Errors

<br/>

![PowerMapper Errors](readme-files/powermapper-errors.PNG)

**Result:** No Errors Found.

<br/>

----------


### 2. Accessibility

<br/>


![PowerMapper Errors](readme-files/powermapper-accessibility.PNG)

**Result:** x4 Level A Errors, x3 Level AA Errors.

All of these errors were corrected except for: 
1. 'A video plays longer than 5 seconds, without a way to pause it'. This is in reference to the header videos that display on each of the main website pages. This is a design consideration. This error is ignored.
2. 'Ensure that text and background colors have enough contrast'. This is a design consideration. This error is ignored.

<br/>

----------



### 3. Compatibility

<br/>

![PowerMapper Errors](readme-files/powermapper-compatibility.PNG)

**Result:** SVG images, CSS filter, and CSS transform are not supported by some older browsers. These compatibility problems are accepted, and ignored. Most Android devices from 4.4 onwards use Chrome as the default browser instead of the original Android browswer, and IE and Safari <= 9 are *legacy* browsers.

<br/>

----------



### 4. Search

<br/>

![PowerMapper Errors](readme-files/powermapper-search.PNG)

**Result:** Offer an HTML site map, and provide a unique page title to each page. 
Using [XML-SiteMaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) a site-map was created and added to the root directory. A unique page title was provided to each page. 

<br/>

----------



### 5. Usability

<br/>

![PowerMapper Errors](readme-files/powermapper-usability.PNG)

**Result:** minor Errors in relation to lack of img-width and img-height attributes making the page layout jumpy when first loading. This error is ignored for this version as its effects are negligible. 

<br/>

----------
